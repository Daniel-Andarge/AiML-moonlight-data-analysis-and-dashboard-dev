# MoonLight Solar Strategy Data Analysis and Dashboard Development

### Project Description
This project focuses on developing a strategic approach for MoonLight Energy Solutions to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability through targeted solar investments. Using data-driven analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project identifies key environmental trends and high-potential regions for solar installation that align with the companyâ€™s long-term sustainability goals. The analysis is supported by a dynamic dashboard that provides real-time insights to guide decision-making and investment strategies.

### Introduction
The objective is to support MoonLight Energy Solutions in enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability through targeted solar investments. This project presents findings and insights from an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on solar farm data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The analysis covers various environmental measurements such as solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, precipitation, and wind speed to identify key trends and extract valuable insights. These insights help form a data-driven strategy for pinpointing high-potential regions for solar installation in line with the organization's long-term sustainability goals. Additionally, a dynamic dashboard has been developed to visualize these insights interactively, offering a practical tool for decision-making and strategic planning.

### Data Preparation

- **Data Collection**: This project utilizes three datasets gathered from solar farms in Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. Each dataset contains measurements of solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, precipitation, and wind speed.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The datasets have been cleaned and transformed to address missing values, remove duplicates, and resolve other quality issues. This preprocessing ensures that the data is reliable and suitable for accurate analysis.

### Dashboard Development & Deployment
- **Design and Development**: Created a dashboard using Streamlit to effectively visualize data insights.
- **Data Integration**: Integrated Python scripts for dynamic data fetching and real-time updates.
- **Interactive Features**: Implemented interactive elements like sliders and buttons for customizable visualizations.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the Streamlit dashboard to provide a user-friendly interface for stakeholders.

### Installation

To set up the Python environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Andarge/MoonLight.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MoonLight
   ```

3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**  
   Create a virtual environment and activate it using the command appropriate for your operating system:

   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **Linux and macOS:**
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Required Packages**  
   Install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Once the environment is set up and the packages are installed, run the project locally:

1. **Start the Streamlit Dashboard**  
   Navigate to the `app` directory and start the Streamlit dashboard:
   ```bash
   cd app
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

   This will launch the dashboard, providing an interactive interface for exploring the analyzed data.
